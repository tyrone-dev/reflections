1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo, you are essentially enabling the repo's history to
be tracked using Git Version Control. It adds the .git folder that contains
meta data that allows the history of the repo to be tracked. It does not commit
anything, when initializing.

It needs to be done so that a directory containing code can be used as a git
repo, with the history being able to be tracked.

2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains all the files of the repo. The repo consists of
all the files making up the project, plus the git metadata that allows tracking
of commits. The staging area is a kind of like a separate area where we can
place files that we want to include in a coming commit. We usually don't want
to commit all the files in the working directory for each commit because we
want to keep these commits atomic and logically small. Therefore the staging
area allows us to select exactly which files from the working directory we want
to commit in the next commit. The staging area is not a collection of files or
is not a directory, nor does is store the version history of the files. It is
merely a space where we can stage files to be commited.
