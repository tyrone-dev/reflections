1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would use a remote repo when:
  - you are working on a colloborative project with multiple people
  - you are working on your code from multiple computers
  - you want to share a project you are working on
  - you want an online backup of your code

2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

There may be changes/commits in the remote repo that add new features or change
the code drastically. You may have been working on an older version for a
while. Pulling these automatically runs the risk of you losing track of your
code or even having your changes overwritten. You might also not want the
lastest commits.
